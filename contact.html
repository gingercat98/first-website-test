  <h3> The reason that I make this website</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Driven by the ideal of Univeristy of People, which promote free education for everyone, I built this website to
    help Vietnamese student study English. Nowsaday, English is the most used language in the world. </p>
  <p>
    Thanks to English,
  </p>
  <p>
    I have the chance to travel, study in other countries. And the best things is, knowing English help me to learn a lot
    more knowledge that are freely published in the internet. When you know English, the sky is the limit.
  </p>
  <p> And that is why, I want to share this knowledge to every Vietnamese student who do not have access to education</p>
